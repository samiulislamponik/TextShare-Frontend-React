## Project Overview

The Text Sharing Web Application is a simple program that allows users to save and share text snippets. Users can enter the text into a text area and save it, and the text is stored in a persistent data store. The program generates a unique URL for each saved text snippet, which can be used to retrieve and edit the text.
